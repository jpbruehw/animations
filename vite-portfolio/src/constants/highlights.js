I lead my team to win by crafting a structured approach to decision making and conflict resolution within the team. With my system, we were able to defeat the competition through superior organization and decision quality, culminating in a 120+ page report that handily propelled us to victory.',

With this collaborative project, I worked with members of the HSLU faculty to develop relevant Python case studies that help future students future-proof their skill sets. Fundamentally, understanding the value, risks, and nuances that technology brings to an organization is difficult, but necessary. With this project, I was able to demonstrate my aptitude in threading that needle better than my competition and prove my perspective\'s value in organizational settings.',

            'My master\'s thesis (written in LaTeX), Predicting US Recessions with Machine Learning (5.5/6), was nominated for this prestigious prize. In my thesis, I explored the relationship between various economic indicators and recessions. I then compared the performance of traditional logistic regression models with machine learning models to evaluate the respective models\' predictive power. My findings strongly suggest machine learning models are better predictors of forthcoming recessions than traditional modelling techniques.',

            'Often the best innovation comes from solving your own problems, which is why I built and published an open source data analytics package that filled a critical hole in the market. With this package, it has never been easier to compare classification models using AU/ROC curves. This package directly recreates AU/ROC analytic techniques from academia and provides them to users out of the box. Now, researchers can compare their models\' performances with a few lines of code, rather than having to rewrite boilerplate code over and over.',
